This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in COBOL programs involving array indexing. The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using an array.  The `bugSolution.cob` file provides the corrected code, highlighting the proper way to handle array subscripts in COBOL for accurate summation. The error arises from an improper understanding of how COBOL handles array subscripts, leading to potential incorrect results or runtime errors.
